      <p>You don’t need another document shoved in a desk drawer or set of rules tacked to a wall. You need your organization to live out its vision. Teams to collaborate. Authors to feel like they’re part of the big picture.</p>

      <p>I’ll help you get there by pulling together the people who affect your content, aligning them around real goals, and empowering them to bring strategy to life. Then we’ll turn your toughest content problems—from messaging to content modeling to mobile—into realistic initiatives people can actually get excited about.</p>

      <p>We can change your content—and the culture that produces it. Together.</p>
